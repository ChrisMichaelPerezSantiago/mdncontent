The percent value must be coded without quotes, must contain the `'%'` symbol, and its value must be between 0% and 100%.<br/><br/>The function can be used in CSS anywhere an ordinary image reference can be used.<br/><br/>#### Cross-fade percentages<br/><br/>Think of the percentage as an opacity value for each image. This means a value of 0% means the image is fully transparent while a value of 100% makes the image fully opaque.<br/><br/>```css<br/>cross-fade( url(white.png) 0%, url(black.png) 100%); /* fully black */<br/>cross-fade( url(white.png) 25%, url(black.png) 75%); /* 25% white, 75% black */<br/>cross-fade( url(white.png) 50%, url(black.png) 50%); /* 50% white, 50% black */<br/>cross-fade( url(white.png) 75%, url(black.png) 25%); /* 75% white, 25% black */<br/>cross-fade( url(white.png) 100%, url(black.png) 0%); /* fully white */<br/>cross-fade( url(green.png) 75%, url(red.png) 75%); /* both green and red at 75% */<br/>```<br/><br/>If any percentages are omitted, all the specified percentages are summed together and subtracted from `100%`.<br/>If the result is greater than 0%, the result is then divided equally between all images with omitted percentages.<br/><br/>In the simplest case, two images are faded between each other. To do that, only one of the images needs to have a percentage, the other one will be faded accordingly.<br/>For example, a value of 0% defined for the first image yields only the second image, while 100% yields only the first.<br/>A 25% value renders the first image at 25% and the second at 75%. The 75% value is the inverse, showing the first image at 75% and the second at 25%.<br/><br/>The above could also have been written as:<br/><br/>```css<br/>cross-fade( url(white.png) 0%,   url(black.png)); /* fully black */<br/>cross-fade( url(white.png) 25%,  url(black.png)); /* 25% white, 75% black */<br/>cross-fade( url(white.png),      url(black.png)); /* 50% white, 50% black */<br/>cross-fade( url(white.png) 75%,  url(black.png)); /* 75% white, 25% black */<br/>cross-fade( url(white.png) 100%, url(black.png)); /* fully white */<br/>cross-fade( url(green.png) 75%, url(red.png) 75%); /* both green and red at 75% */<br/>```<br/><br/>If no percentages are declared, both the images will be 50% opaque, with a cross-fade rendering as an even merge of both images.<br/>The 50%/50% example seen above did not need to have the percentages listed, as when a percentage value is omitted, the included percentages are added together and subtracted from 100%.<br/>The result, if greater than 0, is then divided equally between all images with omitted percentages.<br/><br/>In the last example, the sum of both percentages is not 100%, and therefore both images include their respective opacities.<br/><br/>If no percentages are declared and three images are included, each image will be 33.33% opaque. The two following are lines (almost) identical:<br/><br/>```css<br/>cross-fade( url(red.png), url(yellow.png), url(blue.png)); /* all three will be 33.3333% opaque */<br/>cross-fade( url(red.png) 33.33%, url(yellow.png) 33.33%, url(blue.png) 33.33%);<br/>```<br/><br/>### Older, implemented syntax<br/><br/>```css<br/>cross-fade( <image>, <image>, <percentage> )<br/>```<br/><br/>The specification for the `cross-fade()` function allows for multiple images and for each image to have transparency values independent of the other values.<br/>This was not always the case.<br/>The original syntax, which has been implemented in some browsers, only allowed for two images, with the sum of the transparency of those two images being exactly 100%.<br/>The original syntax is supported in Safari and supported with the `-webkit-` prefix in Chrome, Opera, and other blink-based browsers.<br/><br/>```css<br/>cross-fade(url(white.png), url(black.png), 0%);   /* fully black */<br/>cross-fade(url(white.png), url(black.png), 25%);  /* 25% white, 75% black */<br/>cross-fade(url(white.png), url(black.png), 50%);  /* 50% white, 50% black */<br/>cross-fade(url(white.png), url(black.png), 75%);  /* 75% white, 25% black */<br/>cross-fade(url(white.png), url(black.png), 100%); /* fully white */<br/>```<br/><br/>In the implemented syntax, the two comma-separated images are declared first, followed by a comma and required percent value. Omitting the comma or percent invalidates the value.<br/>The percent is the opacity of the first declared image. The included percentage is subtracted from 100%, with the difference being the opacity of the second image.<br/><br/>The green/red example (with the percentages totaling 150%) and the yellow/red/blue example (with three images) from the specification syntax section, are not possible in this implementation.<br/><br/>## Accessibility concerns<br/><br/>Browsers do not provide any special information on background images to assistive technology. This is important primarily for screen readers, as a screen reader will not announce its presence and therefore convey nothing to its users.<br/>If the image contains information critical to understanding the page's overall purpose, it is better to describe it semantically in the document.<br/>When using background images, make sure the contrast in color is great enough that any text is legible over the image as well as if the images are missing.<br/><br/>- [MDN Understanding WCAG, Guideline 1.1 explanations](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable#Guideline_1.1_%E2%80%94_Providing_text_alternatives_for_non-text_content)<br/>- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20161007/text-equiv-all.html)<br/><br/>## Formal syntax<br/><br/>{{csssyntax}}<br/><br/>## Examples<br/><br/>### Older syntax for cross-fade<br/><br/>#### HTML<br/><br/>```html<br/><div class=crossfade></div><br/>```<br/><br/>#### CSS<br/><br/>```css<br/>.crossfade {<br/>    width: 300px;<br/>    height: 300px;<br/>    background-image: -webkit-cross-fade(<br/>        url('br.png'),<br/>        url('tr.png'),<br/>        75%);<br/>    background-image: cross-fade(<br/>        url('br.png'),<br/>        url('tr.png'),<br/>        75%);<br/>}<br/>```<br/><br/>#### Result<br/><br/>{{EmbedLiveSample(Older_syntax_for_cross-fade, 330, 330)}}<br/><br/>## Specifications<br/><br/>{{Specifications}}<br/><br/>## Browser compatibility<br/><br/>{{Compat}}<br/><br/>## See also<br/><br/>- {{cssxref(image)}}<br/>- {{cssxref(url)}}<br/>- {{cssxref(_image, image())}}<br/>- {{cssxref(image-set)}}<br/>- {{cssxref(element)}}<br/>- [Using CSS gradients](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients)<br/>- Gradient functions: {{cssxref(gradient/linear-gradient, linear-gradient())}}, {{cssxref(gradient/radial-gradient, radial-gradient())}}, {{cssxref(gradient/repeating-linear-gradient, repeating-linear-gradient())}}, {{cssxref(gradient/repeating-radial-gradient, repeating-radial-gradient())}}, {{cssxref(gradient/conic-gradient, conic-gradient())}}, {{cssxref(gradient/repeating-conic-gradient, repeating-conic-gradient())}}<br/>
