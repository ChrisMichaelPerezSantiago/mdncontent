Strings are used in numerous CSS properties, such as {{CSSxRef(content)}}, {{CSSxRef(font-family)}}, and {{CSSxRef(quotes)}}.<br/><br/>## Syntax<br/><br/>The `<string>` data type is composed of any number of [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) characters surrounded by either double (``) or single (`'`) quotes.<br/><br/>Most characters can be represented literally. All characters can also be represented with their respective [Unicode code points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Code_point_planes_and_blocks) in hexadecimal, in which case they are preceded by a backslash (`\`). For example, `\22` represents a double quote, `\27` a single quote (`'`), and `\A9` the copyright symbol (`©`).<br/><br/>Importantly, certain characters which would otherwise be invalid can be escaped with a backslash. These include double quotes when used inside a double-quoted string, single quotes when used inside a single-quoted string, and the backslash itself. For example, `\\` will create a single backslash.<br/><br/>To output new lines, you must escape them with a line feed character such as `\A` or `\00000A`. In your code, however, strings can span multiple lines, in which case each new line must be escaped with a `\` as the last character of the line.<br/><br/>However, to get new lines, you must also set the {{cssxref(white-space)}} property to appropriate value.<br/><br/>> **Note:** [HTML entities](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity) (such as `&nbsp;` or `&#8212;`) cannot be used in a CSS `<string>`.<br/><br/>## Examples<br/><br/>### Examples of valid strings<br/><br/>```css<br/>/* Simple strings */<br/>This string is demarcated by double quotes.<br/>'This string is demarcated by single quotes.'<br/><br/>/* Character escaping */<br/>This is a string with \ an escaped double quote.<br/>This string also has \22 an escaped double quote.<br/>'This is a string with \' an escaped single quote.'<br/>'This string also has \27 an escaped single quote.'<br/>This is a string with \\ an escaped backslash.<br/><br/>/* New line in a string */<br/>This string has a \Aline break in it.<br/><br/>/* String spanning two lines of code (these two strings will have identical output) */<br/>A really long \<br/>awesome string<br/>A really long awesome string<br/>```<br/><br/>## Specifications<br/><br/>{{Specifications}}<br/><br/>## Browser compatibility<br/><br/>{{Compat}}<br/><br/>## See also<br/><br/>- [CSS Units and Values](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units)<br/>- [CSS Basic Data Types](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types)<br/>- [Introduction to CSS: Values and Units](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units)<br/>
